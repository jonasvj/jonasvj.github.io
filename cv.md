## Currently

M.Sc. student in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

### Specialized in

Machine learning, Data science and statistics. 


### About me

I am currently studying on the third semester for my M.Sc. degree in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at DTU. During my studies I have mostly specialised myself in Machine learning and Data science. I am especially interested in the use of Bayesian methods in Machine learning. As a result of my background in Human Life Science Engineering, I also find the application of Machine learning within the Life sciences interesting.

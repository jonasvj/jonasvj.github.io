## Currently

M.Sc.Eng. student in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

### Interested in

Machine learning, Bayesian inference, data science, statistics. 

### About me

I am currently writing my master's thesis on approximate inference for active learning with Bayesian neural networks. During my studies I have mostly specialised in machine learning and data science. I am especially interested in the use of Bayesian methods in machine learning. As a result of my background in Human Life Science Engineering, I also find the application of machine learning within the life sciences interesting.

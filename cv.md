## Currently

Research assistant at the Section for Cognitive Systems, DTU Compute.

### Interested in

Machine learning, Bayesian inference, data science, statistics. 

### About me
<!---
I completed my M.Sc.Eng. degree in Mathematical Modelling and Computing at DTU in February. My master's thesis was on approximate inference for active learning with Bayesian neural networks. During my studies, I have primarily specialized in machine learning and data science. I am particularly interested in the use of Bayesian methods in machine learning. As a result of my background in Human Life Science Engineering, I also find the application of machine learning within the life sciences interesting. In April, I will begin a project employment as a research assistant at the Section for Cognitive Systems, DTU Compute. Until then, I am working as a machine learning engineer at WriteReader ApS.

I am a recently graduated machine learning engineer from the Technical University of Denmark. My master thesis was on approximate inference for active learning with Bayesian neural networks. I have primarily specialized in machine learning and data science during my studies. I am especially interested in the use of Bayesian methods in machine learning. As a result of my background in Human Life Science Engineering, I also find the application of machine learning within the life sciences interesting.

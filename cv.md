## Currently
PhD student at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Compute).

### Interested in
Deep learning, probabilistic modelling, Bayesian inference, AI4Science.

### About me
<!---
I completed my M.Sc.Eng. degree in Mathematical Modelling and Computing at DTU in February. My master's thesis was on approximate inference for active learning with Bayesian neural networks. During my studies, I have primarily specialized in machine learning and data science. I am particularly interested in the use of Bayesian methods in machine learning. As a result of my background in Human Life Science Engineering, I also find the application of machine learning within the life sciences interesting. In April, I will begin a project employment as a research assistant at the Section for Cognitive Systems, DTU Compute. Until then, I am working as a machine learning engineer at WriteReader ApS.

I am a recently graduated machine learning engineer from the Technical University of Denmark. My master thesis was on approximate inference for active learning with Bayesian neural networks. I have primarily specialized in machine learning and data science during my studies. I am especially interested in the use of Bayesian methods in machine learning. As a result of my background in Human Life Science Engineering, I also find the application of machine learning within the life sciences interesting.

I am a passionate and dedicated machine learning engineer with a strong background in deep learning and Bayesian methods. I have a keen interest in research and machine learning operations (MLOps). In my current role as a research assistant at DTU Compute, I am developing a solution for our external collaborator based on neural machine translation and Bayesian deep learning. My educational background includes a B.Sc.Eng. degree in Human Life Science Engineering and an M.Sc.Eng. degree in Mathematical Modelling and Computation. Throughout my academic journey, I have specialized in machine learning and have been engaged in several student positions and projects that have allowed me to apply machine learning in a variety of domains - ranging from medical applications to natural language processing and computer vision. In my master's thesis, I used Bayesian neural networks and active learning in conjunction to minimize the need for labeled data in computer vision tasks.

I am a second year PhD student in the Section for Cognitive Systems at DTU Compute. My research is focused on probabilistic deep learning and development of uncertainty quantification methods for deep learning, specifically in the context of graph neural networks and molecular data science. I am primarily working with approximate Bayesian inference methods for deep learning with a current focus on ensemble methods. Prior to my enrollment as a PhD student, I obtained a M.Sc. degree in Mathematical Modelling and Computation at the Technical University of Denmark. My M.Sc. degree was mainly focused on machine learning and my thesis was on approximate Bayesian inference for active learning with Bayesian neural networks.
